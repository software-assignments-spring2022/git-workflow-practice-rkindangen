<p>This article highlights the importance of having a dedicated designer for the agile / scrum team. In some companies, designers are often rotated between different teams. However, this can cause misalignment between the designer's tasks, which are highly important to maintaing a customer-centric focus for development, and the activities of the product manager, engineers, program managers, etc. This article gives an excellent diagram on how different phases of design work can fit into the scrum framework. By integrating design work into the scrum framework, the team features can be validated and engineers and PMs can provide insights on wireframes. Integrating these two processes brings the team closer to the Agile's customer-centric goal of building quality outcomes for the user.</p>

### Comment by Qianwen Zhu
<p>I think it is interesting that the article points out that the reason scrum was brought in was not to do more thoughtful, customer-centric work but rather to ship more code faster. The article I found also highlights the importance of user experience. The efficiency should not be the only thing that developers pursue. But I believe the existence of the role of product owner could effectively improve user experience as they can build a bridge between programmers and clients.</p>
