<p>This article highlights the importance of having a dedicated designer for the agile / scrum team. In some companies, designers are often rotated between different teams. However, this can cause misalignment between the designer's tasks, which are highly important to maintaing a customer-centric focus for development, and the activities of the product manager, engineers, program managers, etc. This article gives an excellent diagram on how different phases of design work can fit into the scrum framework. By integrating design work into the scrum framework, the team features can be validated and engineers and PMs can provide insights on wireframes. Integrating these two processes brings the team closer to the Agile's customer-centric goal of building quality outcomes for the user.</p>

#### Celina Hu's Comments
I enjoyed reading this article because it is very relevant to our course and I found it interesting to read about the integration of Scrum and UX design. I agree with rkindangen's comment about how integrating the two and having a designated designer on the team seem to place more importance upon the goal of creating a product that is most optimal for the user.
